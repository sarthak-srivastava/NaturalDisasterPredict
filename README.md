# NaturalDisasterPredict
For CodeFunDo++

##IDEA
In India, major natural disasters comprise of Floods, Droughts and Earthquake, each of which has a major toll on life of a large number of people - economically, mentally as well as physically. Most of this can be avoided/ dealt with via appropriate preparation through timely alerts and warnings.
The project aims at developing a probabilistic system to prdict each of the three calamities using time series prediction algorithms(such as LSTMs) and considering scores of prediction from an ensemble of machine learning algorithms (such as Random Forest). 
Training such algorithms on past records of seismic activities, rainfall records, soil quality records, previous calamity history, such disasters will be predicted for a particular region.
Bonus- If time permits, this idea will also explore prediction of epidemic disease breakout via analysis of local hospital records, effectively helping poeple take proper precautions in due time
